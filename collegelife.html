    <h1> What am I studing?</h1>

    <p> Applying for college is stressful enough but not even knowing what you want to major in is even more stressful. I finally decided that business was the way to go because I have always thught about running my own business and that it could be a lot of fun. I thought when I got out of college if I decided that running my own business wouldn't work out, there are several other job oppurtunities I could possibly get with a business degree.</p>

    <p> After getting into the swing of my classes I relized that I wasn't, so to speak, falling in love with the major. After a trip to visit friends at the University of New Haven ended up with me helping them film a video I found that I was intrigued. The more I looked into it the more I relized that I would love to make a career in film making and photography. So I switched my major to video production, classes that I will start in the spring semester, and I will continue to take business classes to achieve a minor.</p>

    <h2> What Could I Do With This Major</h2>

    <p> You can never be certain that the plans you make now will work out in the furture. That's why I decided to go for a minor in business as well so I would have soemthing to fall back on just in case. 
    	As for the video production I would love to be able to work for a news company or magazine, such as National Geographic and travel the world filming and taking photos for the companies to use in their material.
