    <h1> My Senior Year of High School </h1>

    <p> I attended and graduated from Skowhegan Area High School

    	<p> To sum up my final moments of high school, I would say it was great! To start I got a new car, a 2016 Volkswagen Jetta.

    	<p> My theater group won first place at the regional One Act competition! Our show was called A Dopey Fairy Tale and we got to go to states. Sadly we did not win but it was a great time and great shows that all the schools put on.

    	<p>Then I had prom!

    	<p> Lastly to top it off was graduation! A crazy and wild day that I doubt I will forget and I got to perform as well, playing Hallelujah on the alto saxophone. It was kinda a surreal moment cause it didn't seem possible.
